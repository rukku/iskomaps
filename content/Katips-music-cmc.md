    <p align='justify'>From Marikina, alight at Aurora Blvd corner Katipunan and walk towards the <b>jeepney terminal</b> under the Katipunan Flyover.
    <br><br>
    If you’re coming from the <b>LRT-2 Katipunan Station</b>, take the <b>North Exit</b> on the same side as St. Bridget, opposite PSBA. Walk towards the jeepney terminal under the Katipunan Flyover.
    <br><br>
    There are two queues calling UP at the terminal. Make sure you <b>ride the jeep which goes inside the campus</b> (the jeep line closer to Ministop). The other jeep line (farther from Ministop) goes to Tandang Sora and will not go inside UP. To be sure, ask the barker before boarding.</p>
