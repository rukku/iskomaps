  <p align='justify'>From Marikina, alight at Aurora Blvd corner Katipunan and walk towards the <b>jeepney terminal</b> under the Katipunan Flyover.
  <br><br>
  If you’re coming from the <b>LRT-2 Katipunan Station</b>, take the <b>North Exit</b> on the same side as St. Bridget, opposite PSBA. Walk towards the jeepney terminal under the Katipunan Flyover.
  <br><br>
  There are two queues calling UP at the terminal. Make sure you ride the <b>jeep which goes inside the campus</b> (the jeep line closer to Ministop). The other jeep line (farther from Ministop) goes to Tandang Sora passing through MWSS and will not go inside UP. To be sure, ask the barker before boarding.

  <p align='justify'>Alight from the jeep at Romulo Hall. This is the first intersection the UP-Katipunan jeep encounters once inside UP.
  <br><br>
  Go to the Romulo Hall Waiting Shed along E. Ma. Guerrero Road, then ride the next Ikot Jeep that passes by. The Ikot Jeep will take you directly to SOLAIR and NCPAG; both are along its route.
  </p>

<section id='solair'>
  <p align='justify'>Tell the Ikot Jeep driver that you would like to be dropped off at SOLAIR. From Romulo Hall, the jeep will pass by landmarks such as the UP Health Service, University Shopping Center, and dormitories.
  <br><br>
  The jeep will make a turn towards Magsaysay Ave, then pass by Bahay ng Alumni and CSWCD (College of Social Welfare and Community Development).
  <br><br>
  When you reach Ylanan Hall (College of Human Kinetics) or more commonly known as the Gym, the Ikot Jeep will make a left turn to E. Jacinto St.</p>

<section id='ncpag'>
  <h2>NCPAG (National College of Public Administration and Governance)</h2>
  <p align='justify'>The <b>NCPAG complex</b> can be reached on foot from SOLAIR or you may tell the Ikot Jeep driver to take you inside the complex.

  <br><br>
  If you informed the driver prior, instead of turning left at the first corner (towards E. Jacinto St) after passing by Ylanan Hall, the jeep turns left at the second corner (past the Archery Range) going through a street that leads to the NCPAG Complex.</p>
