<p align='justify'>There are two queues calling UP at the terminal. Make sure you ride the jeep which goes inside the campus (the jeep line closer to Ministop). The other jeep line (farther from Ministop) goes to Tandang Sora passing through MWSS and will not go inside UP. To be sure, ask the jeepney barker before boarding.
