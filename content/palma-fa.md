<p align='justify'>If you’re at Palma Hall (more commonly known as AS) and you’re facing the academic oval, walk the corridor towards your left, heading to the side entrance/exit of AS towards the Faculty Center. You will go down a flight of stairs, heading towards a covered walkway, where you’ll normally see street vendors selling banana cue, taho, monay etc.

<p align='justify'>Once outside, turn left, heading towards Quirino St. Turn right at Quirino St. You should be right across  NISMED. This is where you’ll hail a TOKI jeep. There aren’t too many TOKI jeeps in campus compared to the IKOT jeeps, so wait patiently.

<p align='justify'>The jeep will ply Quirino St., passing by the Office of the University Registrar (OUR), then turn right at Delos Santos St., before turning left again at Lakandula St. Step off the jeep right after it turns right at Jacinto St.
