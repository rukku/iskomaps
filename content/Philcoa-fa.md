The first landmark you'll see is the <b>checkpoint</b>. This is quite noticeable as all vehicles slowdown at the guard house near the checkpoint. Alight the jeep right after it passes the checkpoint. You should be at University Ave cor Jacinto St.

If you don’t like walking, proceed to the nearest waiting shed along Jacinto St where you will take a short  IKOT jeep ride. Normally, there are no jeep queues here so just wait for the next jeep to arrive if you don’t see any.

<h1> Fine Arts (FA)</h1>

Alight the Ikot jeep right after it passes Jacinto cor Lakandula (first intersection). The College of Fine Arts Building is on the same side of the road the jeep is on.

If you prefer walking, the College of Fine Arts is a 10-minute walk along Jacinto St., from the jeepney stop near the checkpoint.
