<p align='justify'>If you’re at Palma Hall (more commonly known as AS) and you’re facing the academic oval, walk the corridor towards your left, heading to the side entrance/exit of AS towards the Faculty Center. You will go down a flight of stairs, heading towards a covered walkway, where you’ll normally see street vendors selling banana cue, taho, monay etc.
