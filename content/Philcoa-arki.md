The jeep enters UP Diliman through the University Avenue. The first landmark you'll see is the checkpoint. This is quite noticeable as all vehicles slowdown at the guard house near the checkpoint.

<p align='justify'>Get off from the jeep at the first intersection after the jeep turns right at the <b>Oblation</b>. This intersection of Roxas Ave and E. Delos Santos St is marked by a waiting shed. <br><br>
No jeep route passes by the College of Architecture on weekends so you will have to complete the rest of the trip on foot.
<br><br>
From the waiting shed, walk along E. Delos Santos St with the Oblation statue behind you. Only a few meters ahead is another intersection. Continue walking along E. Delos Santos St toward the <b>UP Press Office</b>.
