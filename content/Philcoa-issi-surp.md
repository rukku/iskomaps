The first landmark you'll see is the <b>checkpoint</b>. This is quite noticeable as all vehicles slowdown at the guard house near the checkpoint. Alight the jeep right after it passes the checkpoint. You should be at University Ave cor Jacinto St. Cross to the other side of the University Ave via the pedestrian lane then continue walking along Emilio Jacinto St.
