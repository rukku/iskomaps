    <p align='justify'>From Marikina, alight at Aurora Blvd corner Katipunan and walk towards the <b>jeepney terminal</b> under the Katipunan Flyover.
    <br><br>
    If you’re coming from the <b>LRT-2 Katipunan Station</b>, take the <b>North Exit</b> on the same side as St. Bridget, opposite PSBA. Walk towards the jeepney terminal under the Katipunan Flyover.
    <br><br>
    There are two queues calling UP at the terminal. Make sure you <b>ride the jeep which goes inside the campus</b> (the jeep line closer to Ministop). The other jeep line (farther from Ministop) goes to Tandang Sora and will not go inside UP. To be sure, ask the barker before boarding.</p>

    <p align="justify">The Faculty Center jeepney stop is one of the last stops of the UP-Katipunan jeep inside UP before the jeep goes back to Katipunan again.

    If you do not have time to spare (10-15 minutes before call time), alight at the <b>foot bridge along Katipunan Avenue</b> connecting the old UP Integrated School compound to the main campus. There is a lesser known <b>pedestrian entrance here marked by a guard house</b>. You are essentially at the side of UP College of Home Economics.
    <br><br>
    Cross the foot bridge, go through the pedestrian entrance, and make a run for it. You only need to run straight toward Palma Hall, turn right at Roces Street and <b>turn left at the parking space (near Landbank)</b> where going to the College of Arts and Letters. Aja!</p>
