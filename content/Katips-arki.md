<p align='justify'>From Marikina, alight at Aurora Blvd corner Katipunan and walk towards the <b>jeepney terminal</b> under the Katipunan Flyover.
<br><br>
If you’re coming from the <b>LRT-2 Katipunan Station</b>, take the <b>North Exit</b> on the same side as St. Bridget, opposite PSBA. Walk towards the jeepney terminal under the Katipunan Flyover.
<br><br>
There are two queues calling UP at the terminal. Make sure you ride the <b>jeep which goes inside the campus</b> (the jeep line closer to Ministop). The other jeep line (farther from Ministop) goes to Tandang Sora passing through MWSS and will not go inside UP. To be sure, ask the barker before boarding.
<br><br>
The UP-Katipunan jeep enters UP Diliman through the gate opposite MWSS (Manila Water). The trip from Katipunan to your next stop is a long one so prepare to warm your seat.</p>

<h1>Academic Oval Waiting Shed</h1>
<p align='justify'>Get off from the jeep at the first waiting shed right after the jeep passes by the <b>Oblation</b>. This waiting shed marks the intersection of Roxas Ave and E. Delos Santos St.
<br><br>
No jeep route passes by the College of Architecture on weekends so you will have to complete the rest of the trip on foot.
<br><br>

From the waiting shed, walk along E. Delos Santos St with the Oblation statue behind you. Only a few meters ahead is another intersection. Continue walking along E. Delos Santos St toward the <b>UP Press Office</b>.
