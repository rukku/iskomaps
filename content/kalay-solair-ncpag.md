<h1> NCPAG </h1>
<p align='justify'>  The NCPAG complex can be reached on foot from SOLAIR or you may tell the Ikot Jeep driver to take you inside the complex. If you informed the driver prior, instead of turning left at the first corner (towards E. Jacinto St) after passing by Ylanan Hall, the jeep turns left at the second corner (past the Archery Range) going through a street that leads to the NCPAG Complex.
