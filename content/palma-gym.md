<section id='as'>
<p align='justify'>If you’re at Palma Hall (more commonly known as AS) and you’re facing the academic oval, walk the corridor towards your left, heading to the side entrance/exit of AS towards the Faculty Center. You will go down a flight of stairs, heading towards a covered walkway, where you’ll normally see street vendors selling banana cue, taho, monay etc.

<section id='nismed'>
<p align='justify'> Once outside, turn left, heading towards Quirino St. Turn right at Quirino St. You should be right across  NISMED. This is where you’ll hail a TOKI jeep. There aren’t too many TOKI jeeps in campus compared to the IKOT jeeps, so wait patiently.

<section id='checkpoint'>
<p align='justify'> The jeep will ply Quirino St., passing by the Office of the University Registrar (OUR), then turn right at Delos Santos St., before turning left again at Lakandula St. The jeep will then turn right at Jacinto St., and cross the University Avenue (very wide road), continuing on to the other side of Jacinto St.

<section id='gym'>
<h1>Ylanan Hall (Gym)</h1>
<p align='justify'>Step off the jeep right after it turns right again at Magsaysay St. The gym is across the street. It’s not exactly sitting along the road but you should see it from the street. You have to walk towards the slightly uphill street to your right to get to the entrance.
