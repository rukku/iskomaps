The jeep enters UP Diliman through the University Avenue. The first landmark you'll see is the checkpoint. This is quite noticeable as all vehicles slowdown at the guard house near the checkpoint.

    The College of Mass Communication and College of Music are the last stops in the outbound route of the UP-Philcoa jeep. Walking on foot from the Oblation will take you there faster. Walk towards Osmena Ave (the Oblation'sright side). You should be going against traffic as the Academic Oval is one-way. Head towards Ylanan St.</p>
